# Note: Usually we exclude large models, but for this assignment usually they want everything or specific structure. 
# Part C structure implies model should be in the repo.
# I will NOT ignore the pkl file this time based on Part C structure requirements, 
# but usually it's good practice. I'll comment it out.
